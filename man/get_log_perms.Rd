get_log_perms(
  X,
  tt,
  y,
  n,
  S,
  debug = FALSE,
  parallel = FALSE,
  num_cores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of dimension S x n, in which each row contains a sample from
the data model.}

\item{tt}{Either: A vector of length n containing the observed values of the covariate,
Or: A matrix of dimension S x n (if there are several covariates).}

\item{y}{A vector of length n indicating whether x_i<=t_i for each i in the observed data.}

\item{n}{Sample size.}

\item{S}{Number of samples from the data model. That is, the number of iterations in the estimator.}

\item{debug}{If \code{TRUE}, debug information is printed.}

\item{parallel}{If \code{TRUE}, computation is run on several cores}

\item{num_cores}{(Optional) Specifies the number of cores to use if \code{parallel = TRUE}}
}
\value{
Numpy array of log permanents,each element associated to the corresponding row in X.
A zero valued permanent is indicated by a -1.
}
\description{
Computes log permanents associated with simulated latent variables.
Each row of the S x n matrix X contains a random sample of size n from the data model. 
If there is only a single covariate, then the
observed data are represented as (t,y), where t is the observed
values of the covariate and y is the vector of indicator variables.
If there are more covariates or the problem is phrased as binary
classification (see Section 5 in [1]), then t is an S x n matrix
since the threshold values change in each iteration. The function returns
a vector of log permanents corresponding to each sample in X.
